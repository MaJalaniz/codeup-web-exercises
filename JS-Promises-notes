Promises deal with Asynchronous actions
like:
-load times
-timed actions
-reading and writing files
-making requests from APIs

**a value** , a request object -> Promises

.then: accepts a callback that will run when the promise is resolved
.catch: accepts a callback that will run when the promise is rejected

                            *****Running a promise vvvvvv****

let goodKid = true;

const getCake = new Promise((res, rej) => {
        if (goodKid) {
        resolve('the promise is resolved, grab cake');
        } else {
        reject("the promise is rejected, no cake");
        }
});

            ****When the promise is resolve or rejected now do this vvvvvv****

        getCake.then((data) => {
            console.log(data);
        }).catch(err) => {
            console.log(err);
        }


        myPromise
            .then();
            .catch();
