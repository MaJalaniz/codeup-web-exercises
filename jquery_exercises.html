        The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
        jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish,
        and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

            jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them
            into methods that you can call with a single line of code. jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated
            things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
